Propagation of blast due to Supernova explosion using PLUTO Code.

PLUTO solves fluid equations by Godunov type schemes using a conservative discretization based on finite volume or finite difference methods.

Here I use the PLUTO code to simulate the blast due to a Supernova explosion which agrees with the Sedov Taylor equation.
