# SNe-PLUTO
Propagation of blast due to Supernova explosion using PLUTO Code.

PLUTO solves fluid equations by Godunov type schemes using a conservative discretization based on finite volume or finite difference methods. It is developed by Mignone et al at the Dipartimento di Fisica, Torino University in a joint collaboration with INAF, Observatorio Astronomico di Torino and the SCAI Department of CINECA.

Here I use the PLUTO code to simulate the blast due to a Supernova explosion which agrees with the Sedov Taylor equation.
